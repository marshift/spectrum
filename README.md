# spectrum
minecraft pack builder for the modern era

## what can it do?
spectrum allows you to declaratively create minecraft packs. it primarily supports modrinth via it's API, but support for downloading directly from a URL is planned.

## roadmap
- [x] modrinth API wrapper
- [ ] parse pack yaml files
- [ ] support outputting packs in various formats
    - [ ] .mrpack
    - [ ] .zip
- [ ] interactive tools to make pack creation easier

## why the name?
"spectrum" originates from an exchange with a friend:

> you should fork prism launcher and add support for marshift pack format, then give it a funny name

> spectrum launcher; lol wait, that actually goes hard
